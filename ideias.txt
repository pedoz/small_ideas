16. YouTube video downloader



One of the best ideas to start experimenting with your hands-on python projects for students is working on a YouTube video downloader. This is the best example of introducing python to beginners in a fun way. More than a billion people watch YouTube every month. Sometimes there are videos we like to download permanently. YouTube doesn’t give you that option, but you can create an app with a simple UI and the ability to download YouTube videos in different formats and video quality. This project looks tough, but it is straightforward when you start working on it.



18. Calculator


Although there isn’t much use for a calculator, however, building your graphical UI calculator will make you familiar with a library like Tkinter in which you can create buttons to perform different operations and display results on a screen.


19. Countdown Clock and Timer
It is another utility app in which the user can set a timer, and the app notifies you when the time is up.

This nifty app helps in furthering knowledge of python coding. It is an intermediary-level project in which the codes will take gather the input corresponding to the length of the countdown within seconds. After receiving the input, the countdown will be initiated and will appear on the screen in “minutes: seconds” format.


25. Tic-Tac-Toe
We all have fond memories of playing Tic-Tac-Toe with our friends in school, don’t we? It is one of the most fun games you can play anywhere – all you need is a pen and paper! Usually, two players can play Tic-Tac-Toe at a time. The players create a 3×3 square grid. This is one of the coolest python project ideas. 

While the first player puts “X” in any one of the squares, and the second player will put an “O” in any square. This process will continue until all the squares are filled with each player putting X and O alternatively. The player who succeeds in creating a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal with three consecutive X or O on the grid wins.

You can use the Pygame library for building this project. Pygame is loaded with all the modules you need for computer graphics and sound.
